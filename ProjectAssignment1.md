# 1. Introduction

Provide a short description of the software being specified. Describe its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals.

Our software facilitates an easier connection between faculty and students about research opportunities and positions, particularly those not teaching undergraduate classes.  Faculty can easily reach out to students interested in their respected major. This application dissolves the barrier between students and faculty in different degree levels, and ensures qualified sophomores and juniors the opportunity to utilize their talents fully and further their academic/professional career. Students also have the opportunity to explore various research topics aligned with their interests.



----
# 2. Requirements Specification

This section specifies the software product's requirements. Specify all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a software system to satisfy those requirements, and to enable testers to test that the software system satisfies those requirements.

## 2.1 Customer, Users, and Stakeholders

A brief description of the customer, stakeholders, and users of your software.

Customers/users include student and faculty that is part of the school organization who benefits from our software.

## 2.2 User Stories
This section will include the user stories you identified for your project. Make sure to write your user stories in the form : 
"As a **[Role]**, I want **[Feature]** so that **[Reason/Benefit]** "

1. As a student, I would like to create my student account, so that I can maintain my personal and academic information accurately in the system.
2. As a student, I want to login to the system by using my email and password or the SSO, so that I can securely access my account and manage my applications.
3. As a student, I want to view all the available research positions for me, and also see the details of the position when I click on it, so that I can explore different positions that match my interests.
4. As a student, I want to view all the recommended positions that best fit my major and interests presented in the profile, so that I can easily find research positions that best fit my profile and skills.
5. As a student, I would like to apply for a research position, so that I can submit my application and be reviewed by the faculties.
6. As a student, I want to view application status and reference updates, so that I can track the progress of my applications and stay informed about any changes or feedback made by the supervisor.
7. As a student, I want to withdraw my “pending” applications, so that I can manage my application list and avoid confusion with positions I no longer want to pursue.
8. As a student, I want to select from a predefined list of values (including date, time, etc.) so I can filter the available research opportunities and choose the most suitable one.
9. As a student, I want to view the detailed information of recommended positions, so that I can evaluate the project.
10. As a student. I want to reference a professor, so it will bolster my credibility in the application.
11. As a student, I would like to view and edit my profile information, so that I can adjust my personal and academic information in the system.


1. As a faculty, I want to activate my account so I can access the system, post research positions, and complete my profile
2. As a faculty, I want to login with username and password, so that I can access the system and post research positions
3. As a faculty, I want to view my account profile so I can have a reference and see recommendation requests
4. As a faculty, I want to create undergraduate research positions so that students can apply to different researches and solve for a real-life problem.
5. As a faculty, I want to view my list of applicants for my research position so I can figure out who I want to accept
6. As a faculty, I want to view a student applicant’s profile so I can figure out whose application I want to approve or reject
7. As a faculty, I want to approve student applications so they can be accepted into the research position
8. As a faculty, I want to reject student applications so better people can be accepted
9. As a faculty, I want to edit the predefined list of values from which user can select so they have more diversity of choice
10. As a faculty, I want to edit or delete undergraduate research positions, in case I made a mistake.
11. As a faculty, I want to be notified when a student references me in their application so I can approve or decline the reference

## 2.3 Use Cases

This section will include the specification for your project in the form of use cases. 

Group the related user stories and provide a use case for each user story group. You don't need to draw the use-case diagram for the use cases; you will only provide the textual descriptions.  **Also, you don't need to include the use cases for "registration" and "login" use cases for both student and faculty users.**

  * First, provide a short description of the actors involved (e.g., regular user, administrator, etc.) and then follow with a list of the use cases.
  * Then, for each use case, include the following:

    * Name,
    * Participating actors,
    * Entry condition(s) (in what system state is this use case applicable),
    * Exit condition(s) (what is the system state after the use case is done),
    * Flow of events (how will the user interact with the system; list the user actions and the system responses to those),
    * Alternative flow of events (what are the exceptional cases in the flow of events and they will be handles)
    * Iteration # (which sprint do you plan to work on this use case) 

Each use case should also have a field called "Iteration" where you specify in which iteration you plan to implement this feature.

You may use the following table template for your use cases. Copy-paste this table for each use case you will include in your document.

# 3. User Interface

Here you should include the sketches or mockups for the main parts of the interface.
You may use Figma to design your interface:

  Example image. The image file is in the `./images` directory.
  <kbd>
      <img src="images/figma.jpg"  border="2">
  </kbd>

<kbd><img src ="md-images/img.png"></img></kbd>

<kbd><img src ="md-images/img_1.png"></img></kbd>

# 4. Product Backlog

Here you should include a link to your GitHub repo issues page, i.e., your product backlog. Make sure to create an issue for each user story.  

https://github.com/WPI-CS3733-2025B/team-resumemaxxers/issues

# 5. References

Cite your references here.

For the papers you cite, give the authors, the title of the article, the journal name, journal volume number, date of publication and inclusive page numbers. Giving only the URL for the journal is not appropriate.
