# 1. Introduction

Our software facilitates an easier connection between faculty and students about research opportunities and positions, particularly those not teaching undergraduate classes.  Faculty can easily reach out to students interested in their respected major. This application dissolves the barrier between students and faculty in different degree levels, and ensures qualified sophomores and juniors the opportunity to utilize their talents fully and further their academic/professional career. Students also have the opportunity to explore various research topics aligned with their interests.

## 2.2 User Stories

1. As a student, I would like to create my student account, so that I can maintain my personal and academic information accurately in the system.
2. As a student, I want to login to the system by using my email and password or the SSO, so that I can securely access my account and manage my applications.
3. As a student, I want to view all the available research positions for me, and also see the details of the position when I click on it, so that I can explore different positions that match my interests.
4. As a student, I want to view all the recommended positions that best fit my major and interests presented in the profile, so that I can easily find research positions that best fit my profile and skills.
5. As a student, I would like to apply for a research position, so that I can submit my application and be reviewed by the faculties.
6. As a student, I want to view application status and reference updates, so that I can track the progress of my applications and stay informed about any changes or feedback made by the supervisor.
7. As a student, I want to withdraw my “pending” applications, so that I can manage my application list and avoid confusion with positions I no longer want to pursue.
8. As a student, I want to select from a predefined list of values (including date, time, etc.) so I can filter the available research opportunities and choose the most suitable one.
9. As a student, I want to view the detailed information of recommended positions, so that I can evaluate the project.
10. As a student. I want to reference a professor, so it will bolster my credibility in the application.
11. As a student, I would like to view and edit my profile information, so that I can adjust my personal and academic information in the system.


1. As a faculty, I want to activate my account so I can access the system, post research positions, and complete my profile
2. As a faculty, I want to login with username and password, so that I can access the system and post research positions
3. As a faculty, I want to view my account profile so I can have a reference and see recommendation requests
4. As a faculty, I want to create undergraduate research positions so that students can apply to different researches and solve for a real-life problem.
5. As a faculty, I want to view my list of applicants for my research position so I can figure out who I want to accept
6. As a faculty, I want to view a student applicant’s profile so I can figure out whose application I want to approve or reject
7. As a faculty, I want to approve student applications so they can be accepted into the research position
8. As a faculty, I want to reject student applications so better people can be accepted
9. As a faculty, I want to edit the predefined list of values from which user can select so they have more diversity of choice
10. As a faculty, I want to edit or delete undergraduate research positions, in case I made a mistake.
11. As a faculty, I want to be notified when a student references me in their application so I can approve or decline the reference
