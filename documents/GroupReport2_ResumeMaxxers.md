## 1. How you used Generative AI
Describe specific tasks where you used AI tools (e.g., code generation, debugging,
polishing UI, testing).
Which tasks did it help you the most?

We used AI sporadically to polish the UI, including better spacing, resizing block and table elements, and implementing collapsible dropdown cards. Sometimes we used AI to check why a get or post method failed in a route, after we wrote most of the queries, but usually we were able to deduce the cause by examining the errors ourselves. Additionally some validator constraints were written with the help of AI.

## 2. Impact on your development process
How did AI tools influence your productivity and collaboration?
Did AI change how your team divided responsibilities?
Did AI save time, create additional work, or shape design decisions?

We used AI to help outline the most efficient approach to planning and completing each iteration, in terms of scheduling and organization. AI helped check our use cases and user stories, breaking them down into tasks, and also helped determine which task would be allocated to each iteration. As a result, we were able to meet each deadline efficiently and punctually. 

## 3. Evaluation of benefits and drawbacks
What were the most useful aspects of using AI?
What challenges, inaccuracies, or limitations did you encounter?
Did you need to correct or verify AI-generated content?

AI was most useful in regards to designing frontend code, but much less for the backend. It could search for errors in the backend easily, but that did not mean its solutions were always correct. AI code for querying, completing forms and routes had to be edited extensively because it made several assumptions about the project’s database, imports, and architecture. 

## 4. Your overall perspective
Do you feel the use of AI tools enhanced or hindered your learning?
What guidelines would you recommend for future students using AI in software
Engineering projects?

AI enhanced our learning by very quickly and efficiently amassing data to answer any questions we had about errors. Whereas before we would use google or stack overflow to know more about a syntax error or learn how to implement various data structures, with AI we received quicker answers that were tailored to the specifics of our project. Guidelines for AI should discourage its usage for implementing the structure of a project, while using it to search for errors and polish the UI is preferable.
