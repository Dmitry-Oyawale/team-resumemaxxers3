## 2. Iteration 1 - Sprint Retrospective

 * Include the outcome of your `Iteration-1 Scrum retrospective meetings`. 
 * Mention the changes the team will be doing to improve itself as a result of the Scrum reflections.

We met almost daily and achieved considerable progress in completing iteration one and some iteration two tasks. We set up the login and registration system, allowing users to access the dashboard as long as they indicate whether or not they are a student or faculty member. Students are additionally asked to provide info about their academic interests and experience when registering, and both students and faculty members are able to view and edit their profile details later.  Faculty can now create positions after filling out appropriate information, and students can view a list of these positions as well as clicking on them to access more information about a specific position. Students can additionally select which positions to view based on a predefined list of values (major, language, course, research topics, etc.), or view a list of positions specifically recommended to them based on their profile. 

The team will continue to implement the rest of the tasks in iteration one, including those that overlap with iteration2, like position applications, sso login, and email verification. Some changes will occur to the UI for better readability, like adding hover to navbar, and better coloring, typography, and usage of white space. We will also allow students to detail their course enrollments in the registration page, and allow students to filter for multiple majors/languages/research topics/courses when viewing the available positions. 

The team worked well in scheduling, and arranging a division of labor across multiple tasks and issues. There was proper communication in the discord ensuring the tasks were completed in a punctual manner. In the future, the team will work to better coordinate and resolve merge conflicts, and be more considerate about UI readability.

We closed the majority of issues relating to iteration one, both tasks and user stories. The ones remaining mainly relate to application, sso login, and email verification.

 * Make sure to update the "issues" on your GitHub repo accordingly.
